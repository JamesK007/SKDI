				<p>
				Welcome,
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Siesta Key Décor has been serving the community working with condominium associations, commercial properties and residential homeowners for 16 years in Florida.  We are extremely proud of the reputation we have established over the years, taking great pride in providing the highest quality service by conducting our business professionally and ethically.
				Jim Kernan, president of Siesta Key Decor, is committed to offering the most competitive bids, while using the most modern equipment and skilled manpower.   
				<br>
				<br>
				Since June 1997 to the present we have been contracted with Sarasota County Government, Sarasota County School Board, Manatee County School Board and many others.  We have done extensive painting and waterproofing for many counties, school boards and associations.  
				<br>	
				<br>
				We are best known for such projects as the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, Sarasota County Courthouse and Historic Venice Train Station Restoration.  Siesta Key Décor will tackle any job no matter how complex.  Van Wezel’s fifty foot high domed ceiling baffled other contractors, but with the right crew, equipment and commitment, the job was done in half the time the contract specified.    
				<br>
				<br>
				Our work place is staffed with drug free, highly trained and courteous professionals, working hand-in-hand with contractors, architects, engineers and customers. 
				We take responsibility of the work schedule, reporting daily to management our exact work location.  The sales representative and/or job supervisor will communicate directly with management to answer any questions that may arise.
				<br>
				<br>
				We utilize the best products available in the market area to give our customers the maximum benefits and the longest life, offering manufacturer material and labor warranties. Regular inspections and written reports by the manufacturer representative are performed to assure compliance with their specifications.  All warranty papers are supplied to the customer.
				<br>
				<br>
				Our sincere desire to establish a positive relationship with our customer includes flexible terms beneficial to both parties.Siesta Key Decors goal is to produce top quality workmanship we know the community and owners will be proud of.  We ensure the quality that you demand.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sincerely,
				<br>
				<br>
				Jim Kernan
				<br>
				President/Siesta Key Décor
